### Overview
We  propose  a  Korean  singing  voice  synthe-sis  system  based  on  auto-regressive  generative  adversarialnetwork (GAN). In an end-to-end framework, the proposed system generates spectrogram from score and text information. Focusing on the difference between the speech synthesisand the singing voice synthesis problem, we develop a model based on GAN for singing voice synthesis. To solve discontinuity problem in conventional GAN,we proposed auto-regressive method for convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN). Additionally, We adopted boundary equilib-rium GAN objective to generates high quality spectrogram.
